<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The key to success with this sandwich is, as ever, fresh ingredients. The spices for the masala should not have been at the back of the cupboard for two years. Make sure the vegetables are perky and the chutney has been recently blended. The bread should be white and spread on both sides with butter (original toasted sandwich rules apply, guys), so that the outside becomes golden and crunchy.</p>
